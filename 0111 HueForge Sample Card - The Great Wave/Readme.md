# HueForge Sample Card

Designed to be a "sample card" to use to test out various colour combinations.

Base picture is *The Great Wave off Kanagawa*.

My filament sample card is 79.5 x 30 x 2.4 mm. (Ratio of 2.65:1) So keep to the width, but allows the height to increase proportionally. Final image size of 79.5 x 58 mm.

Added a gradient to the bottom of the image. This should allow seeing the progression of colours as used.

Consider adding a white border around the outside, so card has a "proper" edge.

## AA -- 2025-02-22

*Basic black and white.*

- m3D black
- BBL Jade White, TD 8

## AB -- 2025-02-23

- m3D black
- BBL Jade White, TD 5.3
    - *This seems, basedon the AA print, about the point that the white is saturated.*
